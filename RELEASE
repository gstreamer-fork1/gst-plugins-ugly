Release notes for GStreamer Ugly Plugins 1.0.0

The GStreamer project is pleased to announce the very first release of the
new API and ABI-stable 1.x series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.

The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API or ABI
compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed in parallel
with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing 0.10.x installation.

Major improvements include: more flexible memory handling; extensible and
negotiable metadata for buffers; caps negotiation and renegotiation mechanisms,
decoupled from buffer allocation; improved caps renegotiation; automatic
re-sending of state for dynamic pipelines; reworked and more fine-grained pad
probing; simpler and more descriptive audio and video caps; more efficient
allocation of buffers, events and other mini objects; improved timestamp
handling; support for gobject-inspection-based language bindings; countless
other improvements.

Most of these changes involve the GStreamer plugin API. The application API
has changed comparatively little, and most applications should be fairly easy
to port to the new API. There is a porting guide available.

The GStreamer team would like to thank everyone who helped bring this release
about, whether by submitting patches, reporting bugs, testing, sponsoring
development, attending hackfests, or simply supplying moral support.

This is the end of a long development process, but also the beginning of
one. This release does not mark the pinnacle of perfection, but the point
where the team is content with the API and stability and quality of the code
base in general, especially compared to the old 0.10 series.

There will be bugs to fix, and starting from this release there will be
distinct bug-fixing and feature development cycles, with the goal of getting
bug-fixes out quicker and unencumbered by other more risky changes. See

for a tentative road map and possible schedule.

=== Module

"When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk."

There are times when the world needs a color between black and white.
Quality code to match the good's, but two-timing, backstabbing and ready to
sell your freedom down the river.  These plugins might have a patent noose
around their neck, or a lock-up license, or any other problem that makes you
think twice about shipping them.

We don't call them ugly because we like them less.  Does a mother love her
son less because he's not as pretty as the other ones ? No  - she commends
him on his great personality.  These plugins are the life of the party.
And we'll still step in and set them straight if you report any unacceptable
behaviour - because there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend:
those with a rope around their neck and the people who do the cutting.

This module contains a set of plugins that have good quality and correct
functionality, but distributing them might pose problems.  The license
on either the plugins or the supporting libraries might not be how we'd
like. The code might be widely known to present patent problems.
Distributors should check if they want/can ship these plugins.

Other modules containing plugins are:

 gst-plugins-base : a basic set of well-supported plugins
 gst-plugins-good : a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
 gst-plugins-bad  : a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
                        rigorous quality testing we expect
 gst-libav        : a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
